First, daily order volume shows a steep decline from January 1st (15 orders) to January 5th (4 orders), representing a 73% drop in just 5 days. This trend continued across the 30-day period analyzed. Second, when examining your most loyal customers (those with 5+ orders), many haven't been active recently.
